# Working with the Bowens Island Private Parties Project

Always ask for a "Yes" from me before writing any code or making any changes to my Github repos.
Please use your Github Model Context Protocol whenever needed.

When we begin a new chat always make sure to understand structure and dependencies of repo "https://github.com/lucasbarber78/bowens-island-private-parties".

After that always follow these steps:
1. Read NEXT_STEPS.md "https://github.com/lucasbarber78/bowens-island-private-parties/blob/main/NEXT_STEPS.md" to understand our current enhancement focus and immediate implementation tasks. Please provide all text exactly as written in the file but don't include code artifacts. Instead, just call out if they do exist.

2. Read FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md "https://github.com/lucasbarber78/bowens-island-private-parties/blob/main/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md" to understand the broader enhancement areas we're considering for future work. This context helps ensure our current work aligns with our long-term goals.

Make sure to confirm next steps with me and make sure that we want to work on them in a given chat. I might have something else planned.

At the end of each chat please ask me if I'd like a summary of what we have achieved in the chat, what items are still pending, and what new items we need to add. Then ask me if I want to update the files:

1. For updating NEXT_STEPS.md:
   - Don't overwrite the "What We've Accomplished" section
   - Add newly accomplished items to "Recently Completed" with the current date
   - Update the "Current Enhancement" section with remaining tasks

2. If we've completed the current enhancement in NEXT_STEPS.md, ask if I want to:
   - Select a new enhancement from FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md
   - Update NEXT_STEPS.md with detailed implementation steps for the newly selected enhancement

Always maintain this separation between immediate tasks (NEXT_STEPS.md) and future strategic enhancements (FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md).

## Specific to This Project

When working with this Cognito Forms to Excel integration project:

1. Always be mindful of the sensitivity of API keys and credentials
2. Test changes thoroughly before pushing to production
3. Consider the impact on Excel users and their workflows
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures
5. Document all API interactions and Excel manipulations clearly
6. When enhancing the schema handling, provide examples of expected JSON structures
7. For GUI improvements, include simple mockups or descriptions of the proposed changes
