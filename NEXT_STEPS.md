- Configuration management with secure storage
- Cognito Forms API integration for all CRUD operations
- Excel handling with pandas and optional xlwings support
- Synchronization logic for detecting and applying changes
- Both GUI and CLI interfaces for user interaction
- Project structure for maintainability and extensibility

## Current Enhancement: Field Mapping and Schema Analysis

Our current focus is on improving the field mapping between Cognito Forms and Excel. This involves:

- [ ] Analyze the full Cognito Forms schema to understand all field types
- [ ] Create a mapping system that handles complex field types (addresses, names, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper data type conversion for all field types
- [ ] Add support for nested fields and sections
- [ ] Update the Excel template generation to include proper column headers and formatting
- [ ] Implement validation based on the form schema
- [ ] Document the mapping system for future reference

### Tasks in Progress

1. Currently analyzing the form schema to identify all field types used in the Bowens Island Private Party form
2. Developing a mapping system between Cognito Forms field types and Excel column types

### Next Actions

1. Extend the `_extract_fields_from_schema` method in both `excel_handler.py` and `sync_manager.py` to properly process all field types
2. Update the Excel template creation to handle complex fields
3. Implement proper data conversion when reading from and writing to Excel
4. Add validation based on the form schema rules
5. Test with the actual Bowens Island Private Party form data
